Web Content Management

Hakili Web Content Management solutions provide a rich environment for creating, managing, and publishing Web content, and an infrastructure for supporting multiple sites
 
Since the Web Content Management systems are built on open-source platforms, supporting, managing, and expanding these systems is straightforward and cost-effective.

For formatting simplicity, we include a transformation engine that converts content from one format to another. For example, incoming images of various types and sizes can be converted to a standard format and size. Drag-and-drop layout lets users customize the look and feel of a Web site without waiting for assistance from developers, and granular control over security enables content authors to secure web pages and the files, images, and videos embedded in them.
 
Hakili Web Content Management solutions provide content management and search capabilities for over 35 languages, including the right-to-left languages such as Arabic and Hebrew. A robust full text search engine supports metadata and keyword searches, and returns results based on the user's access permissions.
