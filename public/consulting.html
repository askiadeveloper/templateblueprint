</p><h1 id="toc0">Consulting</h1>
<p>ThoughtWorks has been providing advice to our clients, formally and informally, since day one. Whether helping to improve productivity or embed testing in IT teams, or setting out a new architecture or strategy, our advice is always firmly grounded in delivery expertise &ndash; in other words, in reality.

</p><p>We consider short-term needs in balance with the long-term business strategy. True to our delivery principles, we won’t create a five year road map with ‘big bang’ results at the end, we’ll create a six month road map with value injected at every milestone, where you need it most.

</p><p>Our consulting approach is not for the faint-hearted. Great improvements require great change, and that is never easy. We will look at the whole problem, uncovering the root cause as well as responding to the pains currently experienced &ndash; and on this basis come, together, to the right solution.

</p><p>We provide services in the following areas, although it’s always best to  <a href="other-offices"> contact  </a> your local ThoughtWorks team before making plans, as it’s critical to have the right person in the right place at the right time for these services.

</p><p><strong>Optimizing IT organizations</strong> - Improve competitive advantage, innovation and delivery capability by adopting Agile and Lean project and organizational practices.

</p><p><strong>Technology consulting</strong>  - Our Systems Healthcheck, Architecture Review and Guidance, and SOA services provide pragmatic advice from specialists with real-world expertise as well as insight into industry trends and the latest academic findings.

</p><p><strong>Testing strategy</strong>  - Rethink and embed testing as a fully integrated part of the software development process to improve quality, predictability and reliability across the IT division.

</p><p><strong>Customer experience</strong> &ndash; Deliver innovative, functional products using uncommon but common-sense techniques that elevate human factors to the same importance as the technology.
