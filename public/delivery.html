</p><h1 id="toc0">Global delivery</h1>
<p>We specialize in building custom systems and products, partnering with our clients on some of the most complex and visible software projects in the world. Whether your project is an entirely new system or website, an update of an existing system, legacy replacement, renovation, or rescue &ndash; ThoughtWorks’ global delivery has you covered at every step.

</p><p>From Inception to production and on to evolution and support, we can work with you the entire journey or just part of it. We’re home to not only some of the world’s best Developers, but also Technical Architects, Project Managers, Analysts, Quality specialists and User Interface designers to complete the picture.


</p><h2 id="toc1">Multilingual</h2>
<p>ThoughtWorks is known for Agile and Lean &ndash; and we do have strong ideas guiding how we run our projects. But we are completely agnostic when it comes to platform. Ruby? Java? .NET? We understand the different tools and approaches, and we have no axes to grind. We can help you decide what’s best for your situation, and work within your existing enterprise architecture.


</p><h2 id="toc2">Your place, or ours</h2>
<p>We can land a team on your site, use our unique distributed Agile approach to do the project with a blend of onsite and offsite teams, or work  <a href="offshore "> entirely offshore  </a>. It’s your call.


</p><h2 id="toc3">Why we succeed, where others have failed</h2>
<p>There’s no secret to what we do, and we truly want to improve the art of software development for everyone. We  <a href="our-approach"> approach  </a> every project individually, but each project we do is informed by these beliefs:

</p><ul>
    <li> <strong>Business users and IT are one team:</strong> we bring business users, analysts and developers together to create and prioritize requirements, review the working systems, and resolve issues all the way through the project. </li>
    <li> <strong>Progress is totally transparent:</strong>  rather than distance ourselves from the business users following a requirements phase, our teams deliver working code to the business in frequent, short iterations (one to two weeks).  The business, our customers, know at all times exactly how the application is shaping up &ndash; because they are using it. </li>
    <li> <strong>Change is the only constant:</strong>  we don’t believe you can lock-in user requirements.  Our approach improves flow from requirement to working software, reduces software work-in-progress, and allows for changes in requirements without starting over.</li>
    <li> <strong>Quality is built-in from the get-go:</strong>  <a href="testing"> testing  </a> isn't a Phase. We use test-driven development, continuous integration and automated testing as essential elements of our process. Whether a bug, bad or missed requirement, the team knows now &ndash; not months later during a separate system testing phase.<br></li>
</ul>

<p> 
</p><h2 id="toc4">Legacy update and replacement</h2>


<p>We tackle replacement of critical legacy systems, often with dozens or more external integration points. Better yet, we can often extend their useful life with new technologies.


</p><h2 id="toc5">Project rescue</h2>
<p>We can assess and rescue troubled projects. By providing our frank perspective on what is needed, and then fielding and managing a team of experts to get the job done, we can enable clients to meet endangered deadlines.


</p><h2 id="toc6">System overhaul</h2>
<p>Our Global Delivery can update an existing system platform to make it more scalable and flexible, and provide critical new features. We preserve as much of the original system investment as possible, and execute a seamless upgrade to the new platform for the business, and customers.
